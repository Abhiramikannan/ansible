Ansible exists in two standards:

	Ansible Core – Provides Ansible runtime for executing playbooks.
	Ansible Tower – Provides management, visibility, job scheduling, credentials, RBAC, auditing/compliance e.t.c.
	By installing Ansible Tower, Ansible core will be installed as a dependency. Below are the steps you’ll use to install Ansible Tower on a CentOS 7 server.

Refer below for ubuntu

ssh to the box
sudo su
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum -y install epel-release



install ansible latest




Step 1: Change directories
Change directories to /tmp

cd /tmp
Step 2: Download Red Hat Ansible Tower
Download the latest Ansible Tower package

curl -O http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz #fails

curl -O https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-3.8.6-2.tar.gz 

Step 3: Untar and unzip the package file
tar xvfz /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
Step 4: Change directories
Change directories into the Ansible Tower package

cd /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-*/
Step 5: Open inventory file
Using an editor of your choice, open the inventory file

vi inventory
Step 6: Identify variables
Fill a few variables out in an inventory file: admin_password, pg_password, rabbitmq_password

[tower]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[database]

[all:vars]
admin_password='ansibleWS'

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password='ansibleWS'

rabbitmq_port=5672
rabbitmq_vhost=tower
rabbitmq_username=tower
rabbitmq_password='ansibleWS'
rabbitmq_cookie=cookiemonster

# Needs to be true for fqdns and ip addresses
rabbitmq_use_long_name=false
# Isolated Tower nodes automatically generate an RSA key for authentication;
# To disable this behavior, set this value to false
# isolated_key_generation=true


Step 7: Run setup
Run the Ansible Tower setup script

sudo ./setup.sh
Step 7 will take approx. 10-15 minutes to complete. This may be a good time to take a break.
Step 8: Confirm results
At this point, your Ansible Tower installation should be complete. You can access your Tower (not forgetting that workshopname is the name of your workshop, and # is your student number) at:

example-tower0.example.redhatgov.io
Ensuring Installation Success


Step 4: Configure Ansible Tower
You can configure Ansible Tower using:

	CLI
	RESTful API
	Web UI

Here we are using Web UI 
	most preferred method 
		by most new Ansible Tower users. 
	Open your favorite browser point to your Ansible Tower server IP or hostname via https protocol.
	
	https://ip:443/
	ip:443/#/login
	
	Login as admin user and password set in the inventory file.
	
	Once you are logged in, you need to configure Ansible Tower license. 
	Browse to the license file and accept the terms.
	
	Get a free account
