1. Single handler
	ansible-playbook nginx_handler.yaml
	ansible-playbook ubuntu_nginx_handler.yaml

2. Multiple handler
	ansible-playbook multiple_handler.yaml
	
Handlers are just like normal tasks in an Ansible playbook but they run only when if the Task contains a “notify” directive. It also indicates that it changed something.
